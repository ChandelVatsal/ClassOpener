# Class Opener (Made for COVID Times) (broken right now)
This is program that was made for students in quarintine. With schools being all online, we had to deal with Zoom meetings and different class pages. 
This program would oepn all of the class pages for the student with a click of a button. It would also join the zoom calls whenever the call started
